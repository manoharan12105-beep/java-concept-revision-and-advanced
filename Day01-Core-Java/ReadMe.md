## 🧠 What I Practiced

### ✅ Variables & Data Types
- int
- double
- float
- boolean
- char
- String

### ✅ Operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators

## 🛠 Sample Code Example

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Day01Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Hello " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old.");
    }
}
```
