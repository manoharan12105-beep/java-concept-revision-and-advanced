# 🚀 Day 14 – DSA Practice (30 Days Challenge)

Today I focused on strengthening core problem-solving patterns in Data Structures & Algorithms using Java.

## ✅ Problems Solved

1. 217 – Contains Duplicate  
   → Pattern: Hashing (HashSet)  
   → Time Complexity: O(n)

2. 121 – Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock  
   → Pattern: Greedy (Track minimum price)  
   → Time Complexity: O(n)

3. 53 – Maximum Subarray  
   → Pattern: Kadane’s Algorithm  
   → Time Complexity: O(n)

4. 739 – Daily Temperatures  
   → Pattern: Monotonic Stack  
   → Time Complexity: O(n)

5. 3 – Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  
   → Pattern: Sliding Window (Two Pointers + HashSet)  
   → Time Complexity: O(n)
