# Day 15 – Big O Notation (100/100)

## Overview
Completed a Big O Notation assessment and scored **100/100**.

This session focused on understanding and validating algorithm efficiency through proper time and space complexity analysis.

---

## Concepts Covered

### Time Complexity
- O(1) – Constant Time
- O(n) – Linear Time
- O(n²) – Quadratic Time
- O(log n) – Logarithmic Time
- O(n log n) – Linearithmic Time

### Analysis Techniques
- Single loop vs Nested loop evaluation
- Dependent vs Independent loops
- Identifying logarithmic patterns (Binary Search)
- Eliminating constants and lower-order terms
- Worst-case vs Average-case reasoning

---

## Space Complexity
- Auxiliary space analysis
- Recursion stack space
- Constant vs Linear space usage

---

## Key Learning

From now on, every solution will explicitly include:

- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- Justification of complexity

Efficiency is part of correctness.
