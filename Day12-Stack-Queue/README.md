# 🚀 Day 12 – Stack & Queue (Java)

This project covers the basic implementation and operations of two fundamental data structures:

- Stack (LIFO – Last In First Out)
- Queue (FIFO – First In First Out)

---

## 📂 Files Included

- Stack.java  
- Queue.java  

---

## 🔹 Stack

Operations implemented:
- push()
- pop()
- peek()
- isEmpty()
- size()
- Sum of elements

Concept:
Stack follows **LIFO (Last In First Out)** principle.

Time Complexity:
- Push → O(1)
- Pop → O(1)
- Peek → O(1)

---

## 🔹 Queue

Operations implemented:
- offer() / enqueue()
- poll() / dequeue()
- peek()
- isEmpty()
- size()
- Sum of elements

Concept:
Queue follows **FIFO (First In First Out)** principle.

Time Complexity:
- Enqueue → O(1)
- Dequeue → O(1)
- Peek → O(1)

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

- Understood difference between Stack and Queue
- Implemented operations manually
- Learned how to preserve data structure while calculating sum
- Strengthened core DSA fundamentals
